# Gyroscope_Simulation
In this project I have simulated the movement of a gyroscope using the spring-mass model and the c++ programming language. I used the SDL library to graph the gyroscope, and assumed that each "molecule" in the gyroscope represents an object and the objects are connected with various springs with a high constant to simulate the motion of a real gyroscope. The most challenging problem in this simulation was to determine the pattern by which the objects are attached together with the springs to make a rigid gyroscope resembling the real object.
